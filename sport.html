    <h2>Cricket</h2>
    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a large, oval-shaped field with a 22-yard
    pitch at the center. The game involves batting, bowling, and fielding, with the objective for the batting team to score
    runs while the fielding team tries to get them out. Cricket is played in various formats, from long "Test matches" that
    can last days to shorter "limited overs" games like One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 (T20) matches.</p>
